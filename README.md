# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

To find the soon to retire employees by department and find those who are eligible for the mentorship program with given employee data assorted below:

-Over 90,000 employees close to retiring
- Most of the retiring employees work in engineering, senior/sub-level staff departments
-Need to start staffing prior mentioned departments: Senior Engineering/Engineers, and Senior Staff/Staff. A baseline number of employees should be determined in order to see if those departments are in need of a mentor program or not
-Not enough managers retiring for mentor program, so that department should be ok and need to be staffed in the near future

## Summary

-Approximately 90,000, or 90,398, current employees will be retiring in the near future
-Although the pool is quite large, in relation to the size of the company as a whole, this would not be sufficient to mentor the next generation unless of course they should ALL accept the position, then a many new employees to one mentor would have to be the how the program is structured.  Pewlett-Hackard has to consider that not all would accept the mentor program position leaving them with too large of an employee count to mentor.

Which would lead to new queries:

So one query was how many fresh young faces are currently working there?

So a quick discovery is that NO ONE IN THIS COMPANY WAS BORN AFTER 1965?!??!?
After running the following this became apparent:

No, no, no... this is not good.

They have to hire new young employees to be on the forefront of the future!!

This lead to the second query:
How many are currently working in each department?

After thinking of new queries about the mentorship program a BIGGER problem was exposed, EVERYONE at this company is 55+ and they will have to deal with a "Silver Apocalypse" as opposed to a "Silver Tsunami". Forget the mentorship program. The above employee count will dwindle quickly after the prior discovery. 

They don't need a mentorship program they need to hire young people, in fact they just need to hire, from the data shown they have not hired anyone in what may be DECADES.

If they're planning for retirement age to be between 65 and 70 they really need to re-think their business model for the next 10 years or they will have ZERO staff by then.
